CHOICES

First Choice: Stick with the PB&J your mom packed you. You're really looking forward to those Hip Tunes..

Third Choice: Approach Helga and the Doctor
Fourth Choice: Listen in on what they're saying
Fifth Choice: Seriously, where did this Doctor even come from? Isn't it pretty suspicious that he ran in just after Mr. Body was murdered? It must've been him. Accuse him.


Third Choice: Approach Danny
Fourth Choice: You've seen enough. Danny's clearly guilty! Taking out the trash? Cleaning up the mess? Come on. Accuse Danny.

Third Choice: Approach Helga and the Doctor
Fourth Choice: This is it! Doctor Database just said that Helga is doing home renovations. Maybe that includes plumbing, so she would have access to the murder weapon. It must've been her! Accuse her.

Fifth Choice: ____
